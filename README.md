When Iâ€™m not obsessing over the perfect pair of pumps, Iâ€™m probably writing SQL to analyze them



In this project, I built a fictional high-end heels database to simulate real-world business analysis. From brands like Christian Louboutin to Jimmy Choo, the database tracks shoe collections, styles, prices, and sales trends.


Using SQL, I answered fun, business-worthy questions like:

	â€¢	Which collection is the most popular?

	â€¢	Whatâ€™s the average price per brand?

	â€¢	How many shoes are selling out the fastest?

	â€¢	Which sizes or colors are most in demand?


ðŸ’¡ What I Used:

	â€¢	SQL Joins (because even tables need relationships)

	â€¢	GROUP BY & HAVING clauses

	â€¢	Aggregate functions like AVG(), COUNT(), and MAX()

	â€¢	Basic data modeling and table relationships


âœ¨ Key Insight:


The Iconic Collection had the highest sales volume, with neutral colors leading in demand. Luxury still loves the classics.
